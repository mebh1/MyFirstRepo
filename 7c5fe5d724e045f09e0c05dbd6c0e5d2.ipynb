A Variable can be a file path on your local machine, could be also a path to a shapefile, could be just a number or letter. Once you create a variable you are assigning a certain space of memory on your computer to storage that information. So you could use it or call it to reference the associated data or object for use in processes and analyses. Note that there are some rules for variable names:\n\nThere are certain considerations:\n\n* cannot start with a number or special character (or, can only start with a letter or an underscore) (for example, x1 is valid while 1x is not.).\n* can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores. No other special characters are allowed (for example, x, x1, \\_x, and x1_ are all valid. x$ is not valid.).\n* are case-sensitive (for example, x1 and X1 are two separate variables).\n\nSince Python is an object-based language, you will primarily interact with your data using variables.

However, there are some other options that allow variables to be manipulated mathematically with the resulting value saved back to the original data object that the variable references. These additional assignment operators can be useful, but you will use the *=* operator most of the time. \n\nFor example, *+=* will add a value to the current value and assign the result back to the original variable.

You have defined a variable *a* that holds a **list** of three values. We will discuss **lists** later in this section. Now, you create a new variable *b* and assign it to be equal to *a*. Layer you edit the variable *a* by appending a new value to the list (You will see how this is done later, so don't worry if you don't understand how this works yet). When you print *a* and *b*, you can see that both variables contain the same set of numbers in the list even though you added 8 to *a* after setting *b* equal to *a*. Or, the change that you made to *a* was also applied to *b*. \n\nIn Python, certain types of objects, such as lists, are **mutable**. This means that it is possible to change the data stored in memory and referenced to the variable. When a mutable object is altered, all variables that point to it will reflect this change. What this means practically is that setting *b* equal to *a* results in *a* and *b* pointing to the same object or data in memory. So, changes to *a* or *b* will be reflected in both variables since the data being referenced by both have been updated. \n\nIf you have  experience in **R**, and I guess you do, you will see how Python is different, as in R, setting a variable equal to another variable would make a copy that was not linked and could be altered without changing the original variable. \n\nTo test whether two variables reference the same object in memory, you can use the *is* keyword. if *True* is returned, then they reference the same object. You can also print the object ID, which represents the memory address for the object, using the *id()* function. Using both methods below, you can see that *a* and *b* reference the same object.

Instead, they are skipped and meant for humans. Different languages use different syntax to denote comments. Python uses the hashtag or pound sign. You can add comments as new lines or following code on the same line. \n\n**Unfortunately**, Python does not have specific syntax for multi-line comments. However, this can be accomplished by adding hashtags before each separate line or using a multi-line string that is not assigned to a variable.
